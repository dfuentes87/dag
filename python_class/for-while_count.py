#Automate the Boring Stuff with Python
#Chapter 2 (Flow Control) Practice Question #13

#Write a program that counts to 10 using a for loop and while loop.
#Instead of two programs, wrote both in one and had it run twice.

#for loop
for x in range(1, 11):
    print(x)

#empty space
print(" ")

#while loop
y = 1
while y <= 10:
    print(y)
    y = y + 1
